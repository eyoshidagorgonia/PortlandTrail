# The Portland Trail

Welcome to the source code for "The Portland Trail," a narrative-driven, single-player RPG that satirizes modern hipster culture through a dark, ironic, and artistically rich gameplay experience. This project is built using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and leverages Genkit for its generative AI capabilities.

## Vision

"The Portland Trail" is a journey of curated suffering. Players navigate a quirky, treacherous path from San Francisco to Portland, managing their stats, collecting ironic loot, and making difficult choices in AI-generated scenarios. The game's aesthetic is a unique blend of "Studio Ghibli meets Diablo II," with a focus on dark humor and atmospheric storytelling.

## Core Features

-   **AI-Driven Narrative:** Every turn presents a new, unique scenario generated by the AI Game Master.
-   **Dynamic Character Choices:** Players are presented with four distinct choices per scenario, ranging from safe to highly risky, each with meaningful consequences.
-   **Deep Stat Management:** Juggle core vitals like Health and Stamina with social stats like Style, Irony, and Authenticity.
-   **Procedural Loot System:** Discover and equip AI-generated gear across five slots (Headwear, Outerwear, Accessory, Footwear, Eyewear), each with unique names, flavor text, and stat modifiers.
-   **Generative Artwork:** AI generates a unique player avatar during character creation and atmospheric scene illustrations for scenarios.

## Getting Started

The main application logic is contained within `src/app/page.tsx`. The game is designed to be run in a development environment.

-   **To run the development server:** `npm run dev`
-   **To build the project:** `npm run build`
-   **To start the production server:** `npm run start`

The AI flows that power the game's generative content are located in the `src/ai/flows/` directory.
