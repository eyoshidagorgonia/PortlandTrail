# **App Name**: The Portland Trail

## Core Features:

- Dynamic Scenario Generation: Generative AI will act as a 'tool' to dynamically create scenarios based on hipster culture and keep portland weird content at http://www.keepportlandweird.com/. Infuse Diablo II elements like unexpected challenges, rare item discoveries (e.g., vintage vinyl), and boss encounters (e.g., a battle against a corporate coffee chain).
- Interactive Trail Map: Overhead map view of the journey from San Francisco to Portland, stylized to resemble Diablo II's map. Add waypoints like 'indie coffee shops' or 'craft breweries'.
- Hipster Status Dashboard: Character status tracking, monitoring hunger, style (Diablo II-style stat screen), and vinyl collections. Add stats like 'irony' and 'authenticity'.
- Resource Management: Simulation of resource management involving fixed gear bikes, vinyl records, and fair-trade coffee beans. Introduce scarcity and trading mechanics.
- Historical Events Integration: Events based on actual news articles and pop culture references from the mid-2000s, presented with a Diablo II-esque dark fantasy twist.
- Choice-Based Gameplay: Simple decision-making prompts like 'Visit a vegan food truck?' or 'Attend an indie band concert?' with consequences visualized in a Diablo II-style impact (e.g., stat changes).
- Pixel Art Visuals: Retro-style pixel art graphics to mimic the Oregon Trail aesthetics, but with a darker, more detailed Diablo II-inspired art style.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted Avocado Green (#A6B86F) to represent the eco-friendly and organic vibes of Portland, but with darker, more saturated tones inspired by Diablo II.
- Background color: Light Beige (#F5F5DC), providing a neutral backdrop that resembles aged paper, but aged and distressed like a Diablo II tome.
- Accent color: Burnt Orange (#CC6633) to evoke a sense of warmth, and also an ironic vintage feel, used sparingly for emphasis like item highlights in Diablo II.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata', a serif, for a literary, slightly vintage feel, but with a more gothic and weathered appearance, similar to Diablo II's font.
- Icons representing hipster culture such as bicycles, coffee cups, and vinyl records, designed in a detailed, almost gritty style like Diablo II's inventory icons.
- A clean, horizontally-scrolling layout with a prominent map and character status indicators, with UI elements framed by dark, gothic borders reminiscent of Diablo II's interface.
- Subtle animations such as a wobbling fixed gear bike when traveling or a steaming cup of coffee when resting, with particle effects and visual flourishes inspired by Diablo II's spell animations.
